# Mias Care Services

This is a website I made for a friend who started her own home care business last summer. It is an example of my ability to do front end design.

I also designed the turtle logo for the site after consulting with Mia, and gave her advice on the colour scheme.

I used Bootstrap to beautify things, and PHP to render the header, body, and footer into one. Regular HTML and CSS took care of everything else.
